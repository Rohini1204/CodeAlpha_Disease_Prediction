# CodeAlpha_Disease_Prediction
Disease prediction task by CodeAlpha Machine Learning Internship

This project uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to predict diabetes using the data from dataset.txt file. The script imports NumPy, Pandas and Scikit-Learn, loads the dataset, prints statistical description and outcome distribution, then groups data by Outcome to observe feature averages. The Outcome column (0 = non-diabetic, 1 = diabetic) is separated from the input features, and StandardScaler is used to standardize all feature values for better model performance. The data is split into training and testing sets with an 80/20 ratio, and a linear SVM classifier is trained using the training set. After training, the script prints accuracy scores for both training and testing data. A sample input is then converted into a numpy array, reshaped, scaled, passed into the model, and based on prediction output, it prints whether the person is diabetic or not. When the main.py Python file is run, the model will be trained, display accuracy values, and provide a diabetes prediction.
